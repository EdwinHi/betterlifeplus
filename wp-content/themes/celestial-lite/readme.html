<h1>Celestial WordPress Theme</h1>

	<h2 id="introtocelestial">Introduction to Celestial Lite</h2>
		<p>Celestial is designed with a clean business style that is capable of handling almost any kind of business or personal website. You will find that Celestial is not only flexible, but it&#39;s scalable, and will last you a very long time. One of the big bonuses of Celestial (the free version) is that I've included the Twitter Bootstrap framework for responsive mobility on your favourite devices like the iPhone, iPads, Android phones, and others.</p>

<h2>Theme Setup Documentation and Support</h2>
<p>If you need theme setup documentation, I have very detailed tutorials (including screenshots) on the Styled Themes website, but you will need to register at my site (Free registration of course) to get access to documentation. </p><p>For support, if something goes wrong, or you need my assistance with anything simply post in the wordpress.org forum for this theme and I will try my best to check for posts. However, if you want faster support, you have the option to register and post your question(s) in the forums at Styled Themes where I can easily be found and happy to assist you. </p>

		<p>The best way to find and install these is to log into your WordPress dashboard and then go to Plugins &gt;&gt; Install New &gt;&gt; search with the plugin name and then click to install from there. If you are unable to do this, then you can visit each of the plugin links above, download the zip files for each one, and then manually upload each one to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory. Then go into your admin area and activate your newly installed plugins.</p>
